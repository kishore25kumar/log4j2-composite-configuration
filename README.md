# Log4j2 Composite Configuration
This is a working example of composite configuration in spring boot.

log4j2-dev.xml overrides or adds the extra configuration to already specified configuration in log4j2.xml
Run the spring boot application to see it in action. INFO logs for root and debug logs for Application class will be printed. 
This is because of log4j2-dev.xml configuration file.
